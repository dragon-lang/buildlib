# Build Library

Contains library code to help with building.

# TODO

* Need to establish a versioning scheme.  Probably use SemVer 2.0.0.
buildlib should probably be downloaded to a directory with it's version, i.e.
```
git clone https://github.com/dragon-lang/buildlib --branch=1.0 buildlib_1.0
```

* Add parallelism to make. Include a "job" module.
